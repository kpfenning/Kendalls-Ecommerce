# Kendalls-Ecommerce

## Description
This is the back end for an ecommerce site that keeps track of all their products. I received starter code from our program and the tasks were to complete the back end programming that interacts with a MySQL database in order to view, update, or delete the categories, products or tags.

## Installation 
To install this, clone my repo from github: https://github.com/kpfenning/Kendalls-Ecommerce 
Then open cloned file and run npm install to ensure you have all the needed dependecies. 

## Usage
Once you have everything installed and ready to use, you will first input mysql -u root -p into your command line. When prompted enter your MySQL password. Then run SOURCE db/schema.sql in MySQL and once that runs you can enter quit to exit MySQL. Finally run node seeds/index to start it up! To test the code run it in Insomnia.
